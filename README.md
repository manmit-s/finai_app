# Finai App

📱 **Finai** is a Flutter-based money-flow tracker app that lets you manually log income, lendings, borrowings, wallet cash, UPI balances, and more — without connecting to your bank.

## 🚀 Why Finai?

- You control all the data manually — no automatic bank sync, no privacy worries.  
- Designed for real-people note usage: income, lending to others, borrowing from others, wallet cash, UPI app balances.  
- Clean, minimal UI built in Flutter for Android (and possibly iOS/web later).  
- Perfect as a side project for learning Dart/Flutter + backend basics.

## 🧩 Features

- Add and categorize **Income** entries.  
- Track **Lending**: money you’ve given to someone.  
- Track **Borrowing**: money someone owes you.  
- Track **Wallet cash** and **UPI app balances**.  
- View summary of total cash flow, net assets/liabilities, lending & borrowing status.  
- (Future) Challenge / peer-to-peer features for lending/borrowing among users.
